We discussed about the magazine’s ideology with Art Director at the time, Teun van der Heijden and the direction they wanted to go with it. We shared a common view and not long after I was hard at work. Raw View was born.\n\nWe began with the publication masthead ie. the cover, publication specs and master pages while simultaneosly negotiating with printhouses and working on the first issue with the editorial team from all over the globe. \n\nIn 2009 the magazine was awarded with the Quality Prize for Culture magazines by the Ministry of Culture in Finland and with The Cult Journalism award in 2016.

Another task was to collect all the necessary components into a library that Tulli could, in time, learn to uphold themselves. Back then agile methods in government organisations were commonplace but having introduced more lean there was also genuine interest in streamlining their processes. \n\nTogether with the team we managed to change the way Tulli approaches their development efforts and influenced them to adopt lean practises.  We held minor user experiments daily and more extensive user testing sessions once per quater and there was even discussion of going open source on some minor systems as a result.",

Enabling the use of a Design System was key, while improving the services current customer experience would be a plus.\n\nThe project was started by mapping the needs of the users and by selecting a portion of the service for the Design System. For this, the user understanding was collected from existing customer surveys and analytics.\n\nAutotalli expressed that they were only able to carry out any design\nimprovements in small parts, so we began by mapping the current version thoroughly. Some UX-bloopers were corrected, the main features were re-designed to meet the needs of the user and the appearance of the service was refreshed. The customer representative was closely involved in the design process as he was also very keen to learn about Design Systems.\n\nThe resulting deliverable was a comprehensive Design System, which was incorporated as part in Autotalli’s service development process. The implementation is currently underway and set to be finished in spring 2019.",
