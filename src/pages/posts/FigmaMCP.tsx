    <p>
      Recently, I experimented with Figma’s official MCP (Metadata Component
      Properties) server in tandem with the dt design system, and the results
      were eye-opening. By enriching the components with machine-readable
      metadata directly within Figma, I unlocked a new layer of semantic clarity
      — not just for designers, but for tooling and automation as well. This
      integration allowed me to embed context such as intent, behavior, and
      variant logic directly into each component.
    </p>
    <p>
      When combined with a well-structured design system, this metadata forms a
      bridge between design and development that’s both expressive and
      efficient. It fundamentally shifts how we think about handoff: instead of
      static specs, we’re enabling a pipeline where components carry the
      instructions needed to generate real code or configure runtime behavior.
      This shift opens the door to smarter tooling, automatic documentation, and
      even generative UI workflows — all grounded in the source of truth that
      lives inside the design system.
    </p>
    <h2>The Problem with the Current Workflow</h2>
    <p>
      Even with well-documented systems, the handoff from designer to developer
      often involves a layer of translation—interpreting visual intent,
      cross-referencing token usage, and validating component variants. It’s a
      process that still relies heavily on human interpretation and manual
      alignment. Small details, like the exact padding on a card or the semantic
      use of a color token, can easily slip through the cracks, leading to
      inconsistencies in implementation. These discrepancies not only require
      back-and-forth to resolve but can also erode trust in the system itself.
      As a result, iteration slows down, and teams spend more time fixing gaps
      than pushing the experience forward.
    </p>
    <h2>What MCP Changes</h2>
    <p>
      MCP exposes design file data directly to code assistants. Instead of
      referencing screenshots or static specs, the assistant consumes real
      components, variants, and tokens right from Figma.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the trials I dropped a component URL into the editor and watched as it
      generated a nearly complete web component. Minor styling fixes aside, it
      was surprisingly production ready.
    </p>
    <h2>Design Systems as the Enabler</h2>
    <p>
      A consistent design system gives the MCP data meaning. Clear token names
      and predictable component structure help AI tools map design choices to
      code without guesswork.
    </p>
    <h2>Generative UI with Natural Language</h2>
    <p>
      I took it a step further by connecting the output to a local tool that
      generates layouts from text prompts. Typing “Build a login form” or
      “Create a three column feature grid” produces a quick preview that
      respects my components and styling conventions.
    </p>
    <h2>This Isn’t About Replacing Roles</h2>
    <p>
      Engineering still plays a critical role in refining the output, ensuring
      performance, scalability, and maintainability, while design continues to
      shape and own the overall user experience. But what’s changing is the
      nature of that collaboration. By automating the repetitive and predictable
      parts of the workflow — the boilerplate code, standard layout scaffolding,
      and component wiring — we’re reclaiming valuable time and cognitive
      energy. This gives teams space to focus on what actually matters: the edge
      cases that define polish, the accessibility nuances that ensure
      inclusivity, and the product vision that ties everything together into
      something coherent and meaningful. Rather than getting bogged down in
      tactical execution, both designers and developers can engage more deeply
      in strategic problem-solving, exploring interactions, flows, and ideas
      that elevate the product beyond the expected.
    </p>
    <h2>Where We’re Headed</h2>
    <p>
      At least my personal goal is to make this workflow approachable for bigger
      teams. With stable tools and repeatable patterns, the gap between idea and
      implementation keeps shrinking. It’s an exciting time to rethink how we
      collaborate—and MCP&#39;s are a big part of that conversation.☻
